# Docora

**Docora** is a domain-agnostic system for interactive knowledge extraction and visualization from scientific PDFs.  
It integrates **backend** (API, parsing, automated annotation) and **frontend** (interactive web interface) into a unified platform.

## Project Overview

Docora bridges the gap between PDF parsing tools and annotation platforms by providing:  
- **PDF-aware parsing** with layout + text extraction.  
- **Automated annotation assistance** (rule-based, Transformer-based, or LLM-based extractors).  
- **Domain-agnostic schemas** for entities and relations.  
- **Multi-view visualization** (PDF highlights, Brat-style text view, graph view).  
- **Interactive editing and refinement** with immediate synchronization across all views.  

The system is designed for researchers and practitioners who need efficient creation of high-quality annotated corpora.
